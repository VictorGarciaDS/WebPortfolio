 37th

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,999
 I received a phone call from somebody who needed my help and they explained to me that this organisation and

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,999
 They explained to me that this organization and Suffolor Cyber Attack, more specifically, a ransomware attack, which is designed, I-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9跟你.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,999
 a ransomware attack which is designed to both steal your data and make it unusable.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,999
 data and make it unusable. It replicates itself throughout the business and can drive you

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,999
 and can drive you down to paper-based controls. And this was an opportunity that I thought where I could

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,999
 opportunity that I saw where I could influence something positively. And it was my job.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,999
 And it was my job to investigate what had happened, how it happened, and why.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,999
 And I saw something that I hadn't experienced before, first.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,999
 I hadn't experienced before first hand. In 2017, the NHS suffered something similar.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,999
 suffered something similar and it cost nearly a hundred million pounds to recover.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:-1,999
 This incident costed around £5 million to recover and took 14 months. Yet, why?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,999
 Yet, what I saw was the human impact. How this happened? A single video, video, video, video, video, video, video, video.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,999
 How this happened? A single individual clicked a link, and a single individual enabled this.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,999
 and enabled this unknowingly to happen to an organization. Multiple people were signed off sick due to strapa...

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,999
 we've all resigned off sick due to stress and multiple people weren't able to go to work the next day.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,999
 to go to work the next day and carry out their job. Now for me, cyber security.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,999
 me cyber security is a very technological focused term and yet...

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,999
 And yet, IBM did a study in 2021, a 95% of cyber attacks, attacks, attacks, attacks,

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,999
 25% of cyber attacks use the human element. Now.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,999
 Now that's all well and good but what does that actually mean?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,999
 actually mean. It means people can be exploited too. There's no lines of code and there's no

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,999
 no lines of code and there's no fancy software. Cybersecurity is the, as far as the media is concerned,

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:-1,999
 as far as the media is concerned, maybe teenagers and their bedrooms causing trouble stealing things.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,999
 or stealing things and learning how to use them. Yet what people don't see is the M-DM-DM.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,999
 But people don't see as the impact on how it's day to day life. And this incident from...

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,999
 And this incident for me made me think slightly differently around cyber security.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,999
 I'm recently I had an opportunity which presented this thought

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,999
 presented this thought process. I was commissioned to evade security. T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t- perfectly clear.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,999
 to evade security controls for a very well-known building in London.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,999
 building in London. That's a snazzy way of saying break-in, and effectively, it was my job to see if I could get past this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,999
 It was my job to see if I could get past the security controls and get into the building.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,999
 and get into the building. And so, for me, thinking kind of outside of the box, this building, da da da, da da da, da da, da da da, da da da, da da da,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,999
 This building has floor-to-ceiling doors, 24-7 skewer team, endless budget for this kind of thing based on where they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they he

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,999
 budget for this kind of thing based on where they are. And so, I think it's slightly outside.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:-1,999
 slightly outside, I need you to come up with a different plan.
